Immunology Background

Components of the human immune system:

	-Bone marrow
	-Thymus
	-Lymph nodes
	-Lymphatic vessels
	-Spleen
	-Mucosa-associated
	 lymphoid tissue (MALT)
	-Immune cells

Immune system—overview of the structure
Innate immunity: Innate immunity is what you’re born with…
Acquired immunity:
Humoral immunity
Cell-mediated immunity
Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells)
Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) (Th subsets):
Th1 (IFNγ, TNFα)
Th2 (IL-4, IL-6)
Treg (IL-10, TGFβ)
Th17 (IL-17)

Components of Innate Immunity
Mechanical and physical barriers: 
Epithelial cells; Secretions: tear, saliva, cerumen, mucus
Cells:
Phagocytes;Natural killer (NK) cells
Proteins:
Pattern-recognition receptors
Complement system
Cytokines and chemokines
Other plasma proteins

General features of innate immunity
Responds to microbes or host cells damaged by microbes
Has specificity, just like adaptive immunity (via pattern-recognition receptors)
Predetermined as opposed to random (as in adaptive immune response)
Provides early defense against infections
Prepares adaptive immune response to mount an effective immune response
Has no memory
Does not react against the host

Epithelial cell barrier: 
Skin
Gastrointestinal tract
Respiratory tract
Urinary tract
Vaginal tract:Can produce peptide antibiotics;Intraepithelial lymphocytes
Peyer’s patch

Phagocytes:
Neutrophils (PMNs):Stimulated by colony-stimulating factors; First cell type to respond to bacterial infections
Monocytes:
Differentiates into macrophages

Other cell types involved in innate immune response
natural killer (NK) cells: destroy virus-infected and tumor cells
mast cells: thought to be involved in defense against parasites; also involved in allergic reactions. Upon activation, they recruit basophils and eosinophils.
dendritic cells: they specialize in ingesting antigens in a tissue, and migrate to lymph nodes where they present the processed antigens on the surface for lymphocyte recognition—also called antigen presenting cells or APCs.  Thus, these cells link innate and acquired immunity.

Innate (natural) immunity:
Toll-like receptors (TLR): family of membrane receptors on mammalian cells that recognize microbial conserved structures (e.g., peptidoglycans, LPS, polysaccharides, DNA, RNA); they arm the cells for subsequent inflammatory response.
NOD receptors: intracellular receptors that recognize bacterial peptidoglycans
Pattern recognition receptors: 
Toll-like receptors
Mannose receptor
Scavenger receptors
Inflammasomes (cytosolic protein complexes that recognize pathogen signals and activate downstream caspase 1:
Mariathasan &  Monach
Pattern recognition receptors—important component for adjuvant development in vaccinology
Nuclear oligomerization domain [NOD], NLRs, STING and DDX41—part of cytosolic surveillance pathway or CSP)

TLRs and their ligands--human
TLR
Ligand (organism)
1 Tri-acyl lipopeptides (Mycobacteria); soluble factors (Neisseria) (Gram +)
2 Glycolipids, lipopeptides/proteins, lipoteichoic acid (Gram +) , lipoarabinomannan (Mycobacteria), porins, atypical LPS (Leptospira) 
3 dsRNA (virus) 
4 LPS (Gram -), taxol (plant), RSV fusion protein, HSP60, fibronectin components 
5 Flagellin (bacteria) 
6 Diacyl lipopeptide (mycoplasma) (Gram +)
7 Synthetic immune modifiers--imiquimod, R-848, loxoribine, and bropirimine 
8 ssRNA
9 CpG unmethylated DNA motifs 
10 ?

Complement system:
Collection of circulating and membrane-associated proteins that prepare microbes for phagocytic killing
Three components—differ in their initiation:
Alternative pathway (innate)
Classical pathway (adaptive)
Lectin pathway (innate)


Innate (natural) immunity
Chemokines: small chemoattractant proteins that activate and facilitate migration of phagocytic cells and lymphocytes. 
Chemokine receptors: receptors on phagocytic cells and lymphocytes that bind to cytokines and chemokines, respectively.  Some of these serve as receptors or co-receptors for infectious agents (e.g., CCR5, CXCR4 for HIV).

Cytokines
Activated macrophages (and other cell types) produce proteins called cytokines (interleukins, or IL) that affect function and behavior of other cell types.
Cytokines produced by activated macrophages (TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12)

Chemokines and chemokine receptors—cont.
Functions:
Chemotaxis, cell migration
Extravasation
Hematopoesis
Angiogenesis—organogenesis, tumor formation
Adhesion—viral infection

Phagocytic responses
Cells (phagocytes) involved:
Macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells (NK), mast cells, dendritic cells
Ligands recognized by phagocytes
Complement receptors (CR1, 2, 3,4, C1qR)
TLRs, NOD receptors
Fc receptors
Mannose receptors
Scavenger receptors

Other effector molecules
Reactive oxygen intermediates:  oxygen radicals, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide
Reactive nitrogen intermediates: nitric oxide, peroxynitrite
Antimicrobial peptides/proteins
defensins, perforin, granzymes, etc

Innate immunity--Relevance to vaccinology
Route of vaccine delivery (skin, mucosal penetration)
Vaccine formulation (killed, attenuated, subunit, DNA)
Enhancement of innate immunity by adjuvants (cytokines, chemokines, antigen presentation)
Blocking of receptors used by pathogens for cell entry (innate immunity cell types)
Inhibition of pathologic immune response (cytokines)

Acquired immunity:
Humoral immunity
Cell-mediated immunity
Antigen presenting cells (APCs) link innate and acquired immunity systems:
Dendritic cells
Macrophages
Others

Humoral immunity
Highlights:
Immunoglobulins are the main effector molecules of the humoral immune system
Produced by plasma cells derived from activated B cells
Immunoglobulins recognize peptides, polysaccharides, lipids, small chemicals


Definitions
Immunoglobulin—(Antibody)—a protein produced by plasma cells 
Antigen: molecule that elicits an antibody response against itself; antigen recognized by antibody to be foreign. 
Hapten: type of antigen that by itself cannot elicit an antibody response, but when complexed to a larger protein molecule, it can engender an antibody directed at itself.
Epitopes (determinants): parts of antigens recognized by antibodies.

Antibody--structure
Two types of light chains:-κ, λ
Five types of heavy chains:μ, δ, γ, ε, α

How does an almost unlimited repertoire of antibodies get generated from a limited set of genes?
Combinatorial diversification:
Variable regions are inherited as gene segments
 
V gene segments (250-1000) in Heavy chain, 252 in Light chain
J segments (4) in Heavy chain, 7 in Light chain
D segments (12) in Heavy chain,
V x J x D =10,000-40,000
H x L =109 to 1011 arrangements!!


Antibodies: types of immunoglobulins______
IgG	protect against bacteria, viruses; enhance phagocytosis; neutralize toxins 	(crosses placental barrier) 
IgA	protects against infection on mucous membranes
IgM	protects against early phase of infection; comprises ABO antibodies; can 	lyse microbes; receptor for activation of B cells
IgD	serves as receptors for activation of B cells
IgE	involved in allergic responses; triggers release of histamine
32

Humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity:Pathway of immunoglobulin production
Immature (naïve) B cells (bone marrow) express IgM and IgD 
Antigens that bind to IgM and IgD activate these B cells (lymphoid tissue: lymphoid follicles of lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal lymphoid tissues)
Activated B cells undergo clonal expansion 
One activated B cell may generate 4000 plasma cells per day
1012 antibody molecules per day!
Activated B cells differentiate into effector cells (plasma cells) that secrete antibodies     

B cell activation—cont.
T-cell dependent and T-cell independent antigens:
Protein antigens (peptides) require T helper cells to stimulate B cells to differentiate into plasma cells—T cell dependent antigens.
Some antigens do not require T helper cells to stimulate B cells.—T-cell independent antigen.
T cell independent antigens (polysaccharides, lipids) usually generate IgM antibody, which has no memory.

B cell activation—cont.
Primary response: antibody response to first encounter with antigen
5-10 days; IgM>IgG; Variable affinity to target antigens
Secondary response: antibody response to subsequent encounters with antigen
1-3 days; IgG (IgA or IgE; isotype switching); More isotype switching, affinity maturation

Immunglobulin modulation
Isotype (heavy chain class) switching: 
Production of different classes of heavy chain specialized to recognize different types of microbes
T lymphocytes involved in isotype switching
Affinity maturation:
Production of antibodies with increasing affinity to the antigen due to repeated or prolonged exposures 


Affinity maturation-- type of “machine learning”
Mediated by point mutations (somatic hypermutation) in the V region genes
Dependent on T helper cells
B cells proliferate in lymphoid follicles with a doubling time of 6 hrs (5000 cells in 1 wk)
Mutation rate: 1/1000 base pairs per division!
The correct mutants get selected because they get activated by the correct antigens and T cells.
High affinity B cells get selected over time to become more numerous

Relevance to vaccinology: Why is affinity maturation important?
Enhance efficiency of target recognition and elimination.
Generation of memory cells that will respond more rapidly in subsequent infections.
Basis for vaccine efficacy!

Cell-mediated immunity
Highlights
T lymphocytes are the main effector cells involved in elimination of intracellular pathogens/organisms.
T cells can only recognize antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to become activated.
T cells recognize two types of intracellular microbes—those residing in a phagosomal compartment and those residing in the cytoplasm.
T cells recognize peptides, but occasionally lipids


T cell maturation process
-Immature T-cells (bone marrow)
-Mature T cells (thymus) 
-Activated T cells (lymphoid tissues)
CD4 or helper T cells:  Th1 or Th2 subtypes
CD8 or killer or cytotoxic T cells
CD25 or regulatory T cells 


Relevance to vaccinology—acquired immunity
Enhancing protective humoral immunity 
Enhancing protective cell-mediated immunity
Enhancing mucosal immunity (maximizing IgA, IgG in mucosal surfaces)
Inhibition of inhibitory inflammatory cell function (cytokines)
Enhancing vaccine efficacy:
Adjuvants to enhance expression of costimulators on APCs to better activate T cells
Designing vaccines effective in T-cell independent manner (conjugate vaccines)
