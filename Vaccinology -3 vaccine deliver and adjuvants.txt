Physical/Mechanical devices to deliver vaccines via the skin
Epidermis: tattoo device/ powder particle injection
Langerhans cell in dermis (liquid jet injection/microinjection/microneedles/gold particle injection)

Needle-free transdermal vaccine delivery methods
Particle bombardment (Gene gun)
Jet injection (Bioject): 
Microinjection:
Less painful than hypdermic needle
Can delivery 100 ul of liquid
Now approved for use to deliver influenza  vaccine
in the elderly (Fluzone®)

Muscle: high vascularity -> high mobilization and processing of antigen
Subcutaneous : dendritic cells  langerhan cells
Intradermal: dermis and epidermis of human skin are rich in antigen-presenting cells, suggesting that delivery of vaccines to these layers
should be more efficient and induce protective immune responses with smaller amounts of vaccine antigen.

Maximize antigen presentation

Microneedle arrays
Arrays coated or impregnated with vaccine antigen to be delivered
Solid microneedles: titanium, glass, silicon, stainless steel
Hollow microneedles:Same materials as above but hollow in center
Self-dissolving microneedles: PLG, PLGA (poly-l-glutamic acid), sugar

Microneedle patch for influenza vaccination

(A) The microneedle patch contains an array of 100 microneedles measuring 650 μm tall that is mounted on an adhesive backing. (B) The microneedle patch is manually administered to the wrist, enabling self-administration by study participants. (C) Microneedles encapsulate influenza vaccine (represented here by blue dye) within a water-soluble matrix. (D) After application to the skin, the microneedles dissolve, thereby depositing vaccine in the skin and leaving behind a patch backing that can be discarded as non-sharps waste.



Tattoo device
Uses oscillating needles
Able to cover a large skin area
Used to delivery DNA
Induced similar levels of
immune response compared to
gene gun, but 10-fold higher dose
of vaccine required for tattoo device (HPV type 16 derived peptide)
Painful!!


Jet injectors
Liquid jet injectors
Around since the 1930s
Delivers liquid stream at velocity of ~100m/sec
Can deliver antigens into muscle, subcutaneous, dermal, or epidermal layer, depending on the pressure
More costly than needle devices; requires maintenance of multi-use devices
May cause pain and swelling at injection site; blood vessel damage

Jet injectors—cont.
Ballistic (Solid particle) jet injectors:
Gene gun—used to deliver DNA
Costly; not appropriate for mass vaccination now
Particle-mediated epidermal delivery systems:
Injects particles/powder into the skin
Particles: 
Gold
Sugar


Implementation issues for a new mechanical delivery device
Can it be used for mass vaccination?
Easy and intuitive to use?
Broadly applicable to different skin types that depend on age, gender, and body weight?
Can it be used to deliver vaccines already in use without changing their properties or formulations?
Cost considerations

Replication-incompetent viruses can establish persistence (prevents cell lysis)
Can express multiple antigens as a combination vaccine
16

Viral vectors: potential disadvantages

Transcriptional activation of oncogenes
Effect of pre-existing immunity against the viral vector
Adenovirus for AIDS failed because pre-existing immunity against the adenovirus
17

Requirements of a viral vector
Attenuation:
	deletion of genes involved in pathogenicity (e.g., thymidine kinase in herpesvirus)
	vaccinia strain NYVAC (deleted in multiple genes)
Restricted for growth in target cells:
	deletion in gene required for growth (e.g., E1 region in adenovirus)

PH275: Vaccine delivery, Part 2:Route of delivery

Routes of administration
Parenteral:
	IM
	Intradermal
	Subcutaneous
	Peritoneal
Mucosal
 Oral
 Aerosol
 Intranasal
 Intravaginal
 Rectal
 Conjunctival
 Transdermal
Peritoneal: into the belly
Intermuscular: systematically delivered
Subcutaneous: dendritic cells (antigen presenting, T cell response)

Mucosal surface is the largest organ of the body > skin


Rationale to consider different routes of delivery of a vaccine
Biologic reasons:
	Enhancing systemic immune response
	Enhancing herd immunity.   <-mucosal (shed) 
	Directing local immune response
		e.g. inducing strong mucosal immune response to protect against STIs
Safety reasons:
	Elimination of needles and syringes a high priority--Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) 
Practical reasons:
	Decrease dose
	Ease of administration, ease of re-administration
	Ease of distribution
3
STI: mucosal surface (IgA, IgG)
Safety: Pain, needle reuse in Egypt and HCV infection
GAVI: provide vaccine in affordable price
Reduce cost, avoid cold chain

Oral delivery of vaccines
Advantages
	Self administration
	No need for trained personnel
	decreased cost
	stimulates mucosal immune response
	avoids risk of transmitting infections by needles
	no disposal concerns
	protective mucosal immunity may develop earlier in life; may not be affected by maternal antibody
Disadvantages:
	Differential bioavailability <- variance uptake amount
	Possibility of establishing tolerance
	Formulation may be difficult
	Difficulty in using non-living vaccines

4

Challenges to oral vaccine delivery
Gastric pH
Solution:
 Acid-resistant enteric coating materials: 
	methacrylic acid
	hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate
	Eudragit (poly (methacrylic acid-co-ethylacrylate) copolymers)—facilitates controlled release
5

Challenges to oral vaccine delivery—cont.
Intestinal peristaltic movement.     <-quick movement, less absorb
Capture by mucus and glycocalyx 
Attack by digestive enzymes (proteases, lipases, nucleases, bile, lactoferrin and peroxidases)
Solution: 
Target M cells: Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1)
Target DCs: TLR9 ligands, CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs), or PLG-encapsulated CpG+vaccine antigens

M cells: immune surveilance, pathogens use it to go into the body, because its short and no microvili, easier to attach
6

Challenges to oral vaccine delivery—cont.
1 Epithelial cell transport
Solution:
	Chitosan: a mucoadhesive molecule--reorganizes the structure of the tight junction
	PLG-encapsulated particles
Antigens need to go though the epithelial cells and reach the base cells
2 Induction of tolerance. <- increase the concentration of Ag
Solution:
Enhance adjuvanticity (particulate antigens)
 β-glucan microparticle
 PLGA:  poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)
 Exosomes: nanovesicles released by eukaryotic cells.   <-package Ag
 Virus-like particles

carbohydrate polymers found in the cell walls of yeast, bacteria, plants
potent activators of the innate immune system
strong adjuvant effect
Selectively targets gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and Peyers patch (M cells)
facilitates rapid transport into epithelial cells

General features of particle-based oral vaccine design:
Designed primarily to minimize tolerance
Nanoparticles more immunogenic than microparticles
Positively-charged particles induce stronger cytotoxic T cell response
Surface hydrophobicity
 Hydrophobic (lipid) particles bind to M cells better
 Hydrophilic particles translocate to intracellular compartments more efficiently

Deliver the vaccine in very concentrated manner
Nano > micro , because smaller are esier to be taken

Transdermal vaccines
Rationale:
	Easy accessibility
	Site of potent antigen presenting cells (APCs)
		Langerhans cells in epidermis (expresses langerin, lectin receptor)
		Dermal dendritic cells
		Both types of cells express large amounts of CD1
     		molecules (which present lipid antigens)
		Several subsets of dendritic cells found in skin
			Langerin-negative DCs: CD1a+, CD14+ (Th1 bias) and CD141hi
		CD103+, CD141hi  DCs cross-prime CD8+ T cells
	CD4+ cells--Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22 
Skin important: lots of immune cells
    
20

Transdermal vaccines—cont.
Rationale—cont.
 Lower dose of vaccine needed: Example--Influenza vaccine: intradermal vaccine just as     effective as IM vaccine delivery, but required 10-20% of the IM antigen dose (Kenny RD et al, N Engl J Med 2004)
 Can be used with adjuvants
  Choleratoxin (CT). ADP-ribosylating exotoxins
  ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT)  ADP-ribosylating exotoxins
  Adjuvants that stimulate TLRs (e.g., CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN))


Topical transcutaneous vaccines (no mechanical penetration of stratum corneum— “skin patch”)—passive targeting
Requires proteins <500 daltons
Mechanism:
 Generation of a concentration gradient 
 Widening of intracellular gaps by hydration

Transcutaneous vaccines—cont.
Immunostimulatory patch
E. coli heat-labile toxin (LT) placed topically induces migration of activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the skin to the local draining lymph nodes (GM Glenn et al, Vaccine 2007; R McKenzie et al, Vaccine 2007)
Showed promise in delivering influenza vaccine
 LT-patch placed at the site of vaccine injection
 Enhanced delivery of APCs loaded with the vaccine antigens to the local draining lymph nodes
Live measles vaccine (phase I/II): induced strong salvary IgA response and IFN-γ producing T cells, but not MV-specific serum antibodies (N Etchart et al, Vaccine, 2007)


Transcutaneous vaccines—limitations
Requires strong adjuvant (would otherwise induce tolerance)
May induce biased response (to Th2, favoring IgE response)
May fail to induce serum antibody response
25
Without adjuvant: induce tolerance

Adjuvants and other immunomodulators for vaccines
Learning objectives
Define adjuvants
Describe the rationale behind the use of vaccine adjuvants
Name the 3 classes of adjuvants based on function 
Describe the known mechanism of action of adjuvants

Adjuvants Definition: a substance, when added to a vaccine, will enhance the immunogenicity of an antigen.
# Induce immune response

Adjuvants used in humans—past and current products
Aluminum hydroxide: used since 1926 with diphtheria toxoid; only approved adjuvant for human use in the US
Freund’s adjuvants (complete/incomplete): made from killed mycobacteria mixed in oil-water emulsion (1936); FCA most potent adjuvant known
Detoxified LPS from Gram-negative bacteria (1950s)
Muramyldipeptide (MDM): mycobacterial component in FCA that has the adjuvant activity (1974)
Bacterial CpG: unmethylated DNA stimulatory in human cells
Other natural and synthetic products that engage pattern-recognition receptors (PRR)
# Freund’s adjuvants <- in rabbits   complete rarely used only in experiments, painful
MDM pain

Adjuvant discovered in 1920s


Uses of adjuvants:
Enhance the immunogenicity of antigens
 Recruiting specific immune cells to site of immunization
  Induction of Th1 vs Th2 response
  Enhance generation of memory cells
 Activation of immune cells to create an inflammatory environment
 Help mature antigen presenting cells to take up and present antigens in lymphoid tissues
 Reduce the amount or number of antigens needed to elicit an effective immune response
 Improve the vaccine efficacy in newborns, elderly, or immunocompromised persons
 Facilitate delivery of antigens in the mucosa
# Reduce amount ->Save money , may reduce toxicity
Baby :Protein conjugated, 

7
Classes of adjuvants based on function:
Those that enhance immunogenicity
Those that serve as protein carriers for immunogenic antigens, esp. for T cell recruitment
Those that serve as vehicles (e.g., oil emulsion) and as matrix for antigens

Classes of adjuvants based on formulation
Gel-based
Tenso-active
Bacterial products
Oil emulsions
Particulated
Fusion proteins
Lipopeptides
# Gel-based: serve as vehicles
Tenso-active: surface tension, 

Mechanisms of action of adjuvants:
Sustained release of antigens (depot effect)
Upregulation of cytokines/chemokines
Recruitment of immune cells
Enhance antigen uptake and presentation by APCs
Facilitate cell migration to draining lymph nodes
Engagement of patter recognition receptors and activation of inflammasomes


Adjuvants: how they exert their activities
1. Physical presentation of the antigen: 
	-stabilize and expose native conformational epitopes
	-formulate the antigen into aggregates
	-organize the antigen into a multimeric structure
	-effect on antigen-presenting cells (e.g., DCs)
		-migration, maturation, and co-stimulation
		-effect on CD4 T-helper cells, CD8 T cells, B cell response
		-enhance cross-presentation of antigens via MHC Class I
     #1.Allows right folding of epitopes
      2.Delivery more antigens in small pack

2. Release and distribution of antigen:
	-slow release from a depot
	-attracting appropriate APCs
	-transport of antigens to relevant lymphatic organs
       # Protect against dissemination:  (TB) max spleen 

3. Immune potentiation or modulation:
	-engage TLRs and NOD-like receptors (NLR)
	-activate STING    
	-affect intracellular trafficking and processing of antigens
	-influence presentation by MHC molecules
	-expand T cells with different profiles of cytokine production
	-expand memory T cell response


Depot effect
Effect on immune response

Tenso-active adjuvants:
 Saponins—plant glycosides or natural surfactants (detergents) 
  Quil A (or QS): derived from plant Quillaja saponaria
  Effect on both T-dependent and independent antigens; also stimulates CD8+ cells
  Used in veterinary medicine
  Too toxic for human use
  # malaria vaccine
Bacterial products:
 LPS
 Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL)—reduced toxic form of LPS (engages TLR4)
 Peptidoglycan (engages NOD receptors)
 Cell wall products
 Active components:
  acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP)
  Trehalose dimycolate (TDM) of Mycobacterial cell wall (CAF01)
  Cyclic di-nucleotides
 # MPL: licensed in US

Emulsions, liposomes, and particulated products
Emulsions (oil-in-water; water-in-oil): <- want ag inside
 Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA) (w-in-o)

RTS,S (ASO2, malaria pre-erythrocytic antigen)-used with hepatitis B vaccine

Cytokines as adjuvants, often made in fusion to proteins:
GM-CSF—recruits antigen-presenting cells
IFN-gamma—pleotropic effect
IFN-alpha, IL-12—abrogate tolerance
Others—deliver antigens preferentially to antigen-presenting cells; preferential stimulation of Th1 or Th2 type response
# cytokines: vaccines against tumor

Immunomodulatory adjuvants:
Th1 induction:
 lipophilic MDPs, lipid A derivatives
Th2 induction
 hydrophilic MDPs, vitamin D3, polyA:U, aluminum salts
Th1/Th2 induction
 saponins

Influence of adjuvants on the trafficking and delivery of antigens to lymphocytes
ISCOMs: Rabies virus (RV) preferentially taken up by marginal zone macrophages (MZM) in spleen, whereas RV-ISCOMs are taken up by marginal metallophilic macrophages (MMM); MZM function as scavengers.  RV-ISCOMs 20-30 times more immunogenic than RV; Conclusion: presentation by MMM stimulates better immune response
FCA, LPS:Can delay  the transport of antigens from the site of injection to draining lymph nodes and affect T and B cell responses in lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow

Mucosal adjuvants:
Lipid A
LPS
V. cholera toxin, E. coli heat stable toxin—increase antigen presentation by B cells
Biodegradable particles—poly-lactide-co-glycolide
Live vectors—Salmonella, Shigella, varicella, etc
# V. cholera toxin, E. coli heat stable toxin— intestinal

Adjuvants for inducing mucosal immunity:
Requirements of a vaccine to induce mucosal immunity:
 resist low pH
 penetrate mucosal barrier. <-M cells
 avoid induction of tolerance
Choleratoxin (or heat labile toxin LT of E. coli): 
 able to elicit memory B and T cells
 T cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-2
 B-subunit good for targeting, but not for adjuvant activity
 Problem: toxicity
