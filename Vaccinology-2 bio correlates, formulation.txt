Biological correlates of protection by vaccines

Learning objectives
Differentiate biological correlates of protection and surrogates of protection associated with a vaccine.
Be able to describe well-established biological correlates of protection induced by a vaccine against bacterial and viral infections.
Describe how biological correlates of protection may be quantitated.

Correlates of vaccine-mediated protection—why is it important?
To establish consistency of production
Knowing who (individual, population) is susceptible to the disease vaccine is supposed to protect
Validating a vaccine when clinical trial is no longer ethical
For licensing combination vaccines

Definitions
Correlate of protection:an immune response that is directly responsible for protection, or statistically correlated with protection
Surrogate of protection:an immune response that serves as a marker or substitute for something else that is protective, that is either unknown or unmeasurable
 
General concepts of correlates of protection
Any vaccine protection can be overwhelmed with a large inoculum size of an infectious agent.
Mechanism of protection is not necessary the same as mechanism of recovery from infection.
Most vaccines now in use exert their effect by generating protective antibodies.
Vaccine-induced memory is important for protection against long-incubation diseases.
Correlates of protection can vary according to individual characteristics (age, gender, MHC group)
Correlates may differ quantitatively and qualitatively.  Levels of protection can be measured quantitatively.

Example: Correlates of protection against encapsulated bacteria and toxins
Opsonophagocytic antibodies: Correlated with protection against pneumococcus and Haemophilus but not Meningococcus
Bactericidal antibodies: Correlated with protection against both pneumococcus and Meningococcus

Caveats: Pneumococcal antibodies--example
Varies by serotype: Antibody titers that correlate with protection varies by serotype
Opsonophagocytic antibody titers less in young and elderly: Due to poor immunogenicity of capsular polysaccharides
Protective antibody titers (ELISA): Developed countries: 0.18-0.35 µg/ml.  Africa: 2.3 µg/ml
Vary by serotype, age
Africa/us difference: background exposure frequency and serotype, biological reasons
Understand biology and epi

Toxin-producing bacteria
Tetanus and diphtheria anti-toxic antibodies:Titer of 0.01 µg/ml protective; Titer of 0.1 µg/ml completely protective for tetanus
Botulinum anti-protective antigen (PA) and toxin neutralization (TN) antibodies:
PA antibody >100 units protective
TN antibody 1/1000 dilution protective

Intracellular bacteria
Diseases for which antibody protection demonstrated:
Plague
Tularemia (partial)
?TB
Most viral diseases
#Tb some evidences against ab protected TB <- mouse
Viral: except for HIV

Viruses
Those injected into the host by an arthropod:
Yellow fever (1/5 dilution of neutralization Ab protective)
Japanese encephalitis (titer of 1/10 dilution of neutralization Ab protective)
Tick-borne encephalitis (Europe and Asia): 125 ELISA units protective
Dengue (under evaluation)
Those that enter bloodstream via the mucosa:
Most other disease-causing viruses 
#Dengue depends on country(endemic) and serotype; 2nd<-HIV

Vaccine formulation: Part 2Attenuated organism vaccine 

Discuss what is known or unknown about correlates of protection associated with BCG.

Attenuated organisms used as vaccines
Organism adapted for other hosts: vaccinia, canary pox, rotavirus
Naturally-occurring attenuated organisms: poliovirus, rotavirus
Temperature (cold)-adapted mutants: influenza virus
Genetically-altered mutant strains: Salmonella typhi Ty21a
Serially passaged wild-type organisms: poliovirus, measles virus, yellow fever virus, BCG

Example: BCG

Organism: M. bovis isolated from a cow with mastitis
Subcultured every 3 wks for 230 passages (1908-1921)
Developed by Albert Calmette, Camille Guérin
1921: first vaccine given to an infant whose grandmother had TB
1950: WHO issues first recommendation for BCG preparation
1960: BCG became available in lyophilized form; seed lots can be made available; no more than 4 generations from seed lot can be used
Today, 100 million doses are administered each year worldwide


Geographic use distribution of BCG strains, 2003-09
Ritz & Curtis 
BCG Brazil
BCG Russia/Bulgaria
BCG Japan
BCG Denmark
BCG Connaught
BCG Pasteur
More than one BCG vaccine strain used
Locally produced BCG, strain unknown
No BCG licensed or produced
No or insufficient data

TB Prevention: theory and practice
USA: 
1 Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis
2 Rationale: 
Disease incidence low
Maintain ability to monitor new infection
Abroad: 
1 BCG given to maintain positive PPD skin test reaction
2 Rationale:Disease incidence high

BCG--quality control
Responsibility of Statens Seruminstitut in Copenhagen:
1 total bacterial content (dry weight)
2 heat stability after incubation at 37C for 28 days
3 ability of vaccine to produce tuberculin sensitization in guinea pigs
Glaxo, Tokyo, and Pasteur strains account for >90% of vaccine strains used in the world

Correlates of protection by BCG:
1 Passive transfer of serum in BCG-vaccinated rabbits did not protect against challenge with M. bovis in rabbits
2 Mice receiving T-lymphocytes from BCG-vaccinated mice showed decreased number of M tuberculosis organism recovered from spleen and lung after challenge
3 CD8+ cells in spleen of BCG-vaccinated mice controlled Mtb infection—basis for preventing dissemination??
4 BCG does not prevent infection in mouse lungs; number of organisms recovered not significantly different until 14 days after challenge

BCG vaccine effectiveness--reasons for variability in clinical trials
Affected by previous infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria:
decreased susceptibility of control group
Differences in the potency/immunogenicity of the batches of vaccine:
Different BCG strains? (Pasteur, Connaught, Japan, Denmark, Brazil) 
Differences in the risk of infection, in virulence of M. tuberculosis strains, genetics of hosts: Circulating predominant lineages (e.g., Beijing clade in northern hemisphere)
Differences in study methodology:
Clemens et al JAMA 1983;249:2362
Colditz et al JAMA 1994;271:698


Protection greatest in:
Children stringently tested by tuberculin skin test (TST)
Against meningitis and miliary TB in infants
Further away from Equator
Protection not associated with:
BCG vaccine strain
Children or older people not stringently tested by TST

BCG vaccine side effects
Lubeck Incident: 1930: Lubeck, Germany: 72/251 vaccinated children died; not BCG but M. tuberculosis 
Most common complication: lymphadenitis
Most serious complication: disseminated disease
BCG and HIV infection:
1 Lallemant-La Coeur: 194 children (64 HIV+); 40 months of f/u: lymphadenitis in 24% of HIV+, 18% in HIV- children
2 Rwanda: 377 children: 6 suppuration at injection site; 1 was in HIV+ child; 1 in HIV- child whose mother was HIV+; 4 HIV- children
Hesseling et al (2007): Mathematical modeling: incidence of disseminated BCG disease of 329 and 417 per 100,000 vaccine recipients in South Africa (assuming 95% coverage)
WHO no longer recommends BCG in asymptomatic HIV+ children at risk for TB (WHO, 2007)


Basis for WHO recommendation on BCG vaccination in children infected with HIV:
Infants asymptomatically infected with HIV at birth given BCG has a later risk of disseminated BCG infection of 407-1300 per 100,000.


Evaluation of >80,000 individuals with BCG scar (Glaxo)
Protection against leprosy:
multibacillary: 84%
paucibacillary: 51%
Protection against tuberculosis: 
pulmonary: 5%
extrapulmonary: -6%

What’s good with BCG
BCG may protect against leprosy
BCG may protect against development of asthma later in life? 
BCG used as a delivery vehicle for new anti-TB vaccines

BCG— “take-home” message
Effective for preventing disseminated TB in children
Overall effectiveness is ~50%
Not effective against pulmonary TB
Not effective in preventing reactivation TB
No evidence of enhanced protection by booster BCG
Not to be given to HIV-infected children


Key biology questions:
Why do only some people latently infected with M. tuberculosis develop active disease?
How does BCG protect children while remaining ineffective in preventing pulmonary disease in adults?
What antigenic factors are needed to trigger protective and long-lasting immune responses against TB?

Current measures of “protective” immune response
CD4+ T cells
CD8+ T cells
γδ+ T cells
Induction of IFNγ response
Induction of Th17 response
IL2
Are these responses found in children or adults vaccinated with BCG and do they correlate with protection?


Newborns in South Africa vaccinated with BCG
5,662 infants enrolled and followed for 2 years
29 developed TB
Compared cytokine expression patterns of  T cells (CD4, CD8, γδ) incubated with BCG:
TB cases (29)
Comparison infants—household (n=55) and community (n=55)

BCG: Why it’s not enough
Recommended by WHO to be administered to only newborns (not for infants with HIV infection).
Protects against disseminated TB in children (e.g., meningitis).
Poor effectiveness against pulmonary TB.
Does not protect against reactivation TB.
Overall effectiveness about 50% (based on meta-analyses-- Clemens et al JAMA 1983; 249:2362; Colditz et al JAMA 1994;271:698).
Clearly need a better vaccine against TB!

Vaccine Formulation: Part 3

Learning objectives

Describe the limitations of the two formulations of the pertussis vaccine.
Provide reasons for why the pertussis acellular vaccine may not be protective long term.
Speculate on how you could improve on the currently available pertussis vaccines

Example 1: Pertussis vaccines
Why do we need a vaccine against pertussis?

Bordatella pertussis 
(one of 9 spp of Bordatella)
Described in 1900 by Bordet 
and Gengou
Small, Gram-negative bacterium
Other Bordatella spp associated with bronchitis:
	B. parapertussis
	B. bronchiseptica

Disease caused by Bordatella pertussis
Also called whooping cough
Highest incidence in infants 
Clinical manifestation in adolescents and adults atypical; leads to delay in diagnosis

Pertussis--Epidemiology
Worldwide occurrence
-One of top 10 causes of death in infants
-~2 million new cases and 200,000 deaths mostly in infants, 90% in developing countries
Developed countries:
-Increasing incidence 
-Two peaks in incidence: 
> 10 years of age
<5 months of age

Pertussis in the United States
265,269 in 1934
48,277 cases in 2012—most since 1955!
20, 762 in 2015
15, 737 in 2016


Recent pertussis outbreaks in the United States (CDC)
Washington state: 4424 cases through Oct 24, 2012 (595 in all of 2011)
Minnesota: 3853 through Oct 18, 2012 (661 in all of 2011)
Wisconsin: 4918 through Oct 14, 2012 (1192 in 2011)
Colorado: 1134 through Oct 29, 2012 (average of 158/yr in 2007-2011)
California: 1830 cases in 2016
California: 495 as of May 11, 2017
11,203 cases in 2014!


Pertussis cases, California,1945-2016two peaks: Jun 2010 and Jul 2014

Pertussis in CA--age distribution, 2016
Two peaks: 1-4 (more 1) and 14-16

Pertussis in CA: ethnic distribution, 2016
More cases: white non-hispanic

Transmission
Highly infectious during the initial catarrhal period and 2 weeks of spasmodic cough, and can remain infectious up to 6 wks after.
Unprotected or partially protected adults and adolescents may serve as reservoir for the infants.
Secondary attack rate: 80%
Adolescents and adults major source of transmission

Possible reasons for the new epidemiology of pertussis in developed countries
Waning protective immunity from vaccine
Exposure to infected infants
Exposure to infected adolescents
New strains?
Increased reporting?
Vaccine exemptions?

Pertussis vaccines--formulations
1 wP: Whole cell, inactivated: 
Introduced in the 1930s, used in combination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccines
Effective but associated with severe side effects in some children:
	Encephalopathy
	Seizures (associated with mutation in sodium channel gene SCN1A)
Difficult to maintain consistency due to strain variability
Highly immunogenic; immunity long-lasting
Variable growth and plasticity—variable protein expression relative to growth conditions—regulated by BvgAS regulon
Makes standardization of cultures difficult

2 aP: Acellular vaccine:
Introduced in the US in 1997
(Pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemaglutinnin [FHA], pertactin [PRN] and two different fimbrial proteins)
Immunity not long-lasting
Reports of strains that lack toxin and pertactin

B. pertussis toxins and virulence factors
Pertussis toxin (PT)
Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) 
Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT)
Heat-labile toxin
Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
Receptor-binding virulence factors
including filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN),
Fimbriae

B. pertussis toxins and virulence factors
Master regulator--BvgAS—regulates the following class of genes:
Class 1: Pertussis toxin (PT) (transported by type IV secretion system); bsc operon (Type III secretion system—secretes BteA, a possible cytotoxin)
Class 2: Filamentous hemagglutinin (Fha), fim genes (which encode fimbriae)
Class 3: bipA, encodes an outer membrane protein of unknown function
Class 4: vrg (virulence-repressed genes) maximally expressed when Bvg is not expressed (Bvg-)


B. pertussis toxins
1 Pertussis toxin (PT): 
ADP-ribosylating AB toxin--  up-regulate cyclic AMP
Suppresses EARLY proinflammatory response
Antibody against PT protective
2 Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT):
Forms pores in target cell membrane
Translocates adenylate cyclase into cells (up-regulate cyclic AMP)
Increased cAMP causes perturbation of cell signaling
3 Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) 
functions synergistically with lipo-oligosaccharide to stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-6)
Recognized by NOD1 intracellularly
Causes destruction of ciliated cells
4 Dermonecrotic toxin
Not secreted by bacteria, so its role in pathogenesis is unclear; maybe necessary for bacterial survival inside a host.

Bacterial surface structures important for virulence 

Correlates of protection?--pertussis
Pw: Immune protection associated with Th1 T cell response
Adoptive transfer of Pw-vaccinated mice protective for challenged recipient mice
Pa: Induces Th2 and Th17 responses
Children with anti-PT antibodies have less severe symptoms

Duration of protection from vaccination
Whole cell vaccine: 4-14 yrs
Acellular vaccine: 5-6 yrs
Depends on number of doses; >2 needed for protection
Some evidence of T cell memory response induced by Pa—symptoms less severe in older children

Waning immunity?
How do you demonstrate waning immunity after aP vaccine?
Outbreaks began 5-6 years after introduction in several countries—suggests biological factor.
What is known about correlates of protection?
Can we measure these correlates of protection?
What outcomes are affected? severe disease? culture-positive cases? carriage? transmission? (e.g., first trial of Pa vaccine in Sweden in 1986)
What do we know about correlates of protection by wP?

How was aP vaccine shown to be more immunogenic than wP vaccine in Swedish and Italian studies?
Connaught Pw vaccine not highly immunogenic
Measured antibody titers (PT, FHA) to assess protection: Problems: 1) Ab titers never been shown to correlate with protection, 2) Pa had higher concentration of PT, FHA
No measures of long-term effectiveness done
No indirect measures of effectiveness performed (herd immunity)

Other factors possibly associated with resurgence of pertussis
Bias in reporting? More PCR-based tests—picks up milder cases
Evolutionary shift (changes in antigen epitopes)? 
mutations in PT and fimbrial genes over time (escape mutants)
strains over-producing PT 
strains that no longer express pertactin, FHA, PT
aP unable to block transmission (herd immunity)
Failure of “cocooning” strategy
Poor inducer of mucosal immunity

aP protects against disease but not asymptomatic infection.

Example 2: Pneumococcal vaccines

Why do we need a vaccine against pneumococcal infections?

Streptococcus pneumoniae Pneumococcus)
Gram-positive diplococcus
Alpha-hemolytic on sheep blood agar
>93 serotypes
11 serotypes responsible for 70-93%
     of invasive diseases globally

Pneumococcal invasive diseases(Clin Infect Dis. 2000;30:100-21)
Sepsis
Pneumonia
Meningitis
Peritonitis
Otitis

Age-related invasive pneumococcal disease/100,000, UK and Wales 1996-2005
Peak in 6-11 months baby and 80+ years

Etiology
 >91 capsular types or serotypes

Pneumococcal invasive disease—association with serogroups
Serogroups associated with invasive disease:
5-8 serogroups account for 75% of invasive disease in young children; 
10-11 serogroups in older children and adults account for 75% of invasive disease
Serogroup 4,6,9,14,18,19, and 23 cause 70-88% of invasive disease in the US, Canada, Oceania, Africa, and Europe; <65% in Latin America
Above serogroups plus 1 and 5 cause 80-90% of invasive disease in each region except Asia (66%)
Other serogroups significant causes of disease in older children and adults

Antibiotic resistance (PCN):
Some countries > 40%

Incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in children and adults, 1998-2015, USA (CDC)
<5 yrs decreased after PCV7, decreased again after PCV13
19-64 yrs older people decreased after PCV 7 and again after PCV13

Incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults >65 yrs, 1998-2015, USA (CDC)

Pathogenesis
Genome
1553 essential genes
154 genes (“virulome”)
176 genes—non-invasive phenotype
13 “regions of diversity” (determines invasive vs non-invasive phenotypes)


Pathogenesis:
Asymptomatic carriage mediated by non-invasive clones of Pneumococcus
Adhesins
IgA1 protease
Inhibitors of antibacterial peptides
Defects in host immunity can cause non-invasive clones to cause disease.

The above bacterial factors help to maintain colonization and efficient spread in the human population.
Neutrophils are effector cells of innate immunity, killing microbes using phagocytosis and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils also generate a variety of immune mediators to direct immune responses, influencing other cells of innate and adaptive immunity. Finally, neutrophils damage tissues, with products such as proteases and reactive oxygen species injuring cells and digesting matrix. TNF denotes tumor necrosis factor.

Pathogenesis
Invasive disease:
Anti-phagocytic factor (capsule)
Adhesion factors (surface protein A, neuraminidase, phosphorylcholine, enolase)
Invasion factors (pili, serine-rich repeat protein )
Iron transporters (ABC transporters)
Oxidative stress protection
Host evasion factors (capsule) 
Pneumolysin (type of exotosin--impairs cilia, respiratory burst; promotes cytokine production)
Bacteriocin (kills other bacteria)
Quorum sensing
Biofilm production


Pneumococcal capsule
Prevents mechanical clearance by mucus secretion
Prevents phagocytosis by inhibiting interaction of complement iC3b to receptors (CR3)
Inhibits interaction of Fcγ receptors to Fc of IgG
Reduces exposures to antibiotics
Target of vaccines


Pneumococcal vaccines--history

Whole cell vaccine: 1911
4-/6-valent polysaccharide: 1945/6
PPV14: 1977

PPV23: 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine—Cochrane review (Moberly et al, 2013)
25 studies 
18 RCTs (64,852 participants)
7 non-RCTs (62,294 participants)
Effective against invasive pulmonary disease (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.45)
Effective against all-cause pneumonia in low-income (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.67, I2 statistic = 19%) but not high-income countries (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.12) 
No effect on all-cause mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09)
Efficacy poorer in adults with chronic illness. 

Antibody response to PPV23

Polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines
Examples of bacterial polysaccharide antigens:
Capsular polysaccharides (CPS)
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
Lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS)


Polysaccharides-conjugate vaccines: principles
Haptens: small molecules made immunogenic after conjugation to carrier proteins
TI antigens: antigens that activate B cells independent of T cells (Thymus-independent antigens)
TI-1: antigens that can activate immature B-cells (mitogenic activity): e.g., LPS
TI-2: antigens that cannot activate immature B-cells: e.g., pneumococcal polysaccharides, H. influenza B polysaccharides, meningococcal polysaccharides
T cells with specificity for saccharide structures in association with MHC structures not identified/known
22

Polysaccharide-conjugates: requirements for immunogenicity
If conjugated, minimum chain length of 2 RU can raise an antibody that recognizes native polysaccharide
Such an antigen elicits poor antibody response in unprimed B cells (e.g., in infants)
Minimal number of unmodified repeat units (RU)
Bacterial pili
Outer membrane proteins
Excreted toxins (toxoids; e.gl, tetanus, diphtheria)
CRM 197 (nontoxic analog of diphtheria toxoid)
Use of proteins from the homologous bacterial species from which the polysaccharide is derived
Type of carrier proteins
covalent bond required
Coupling methods: 
Saccharide-to-protein ratio
