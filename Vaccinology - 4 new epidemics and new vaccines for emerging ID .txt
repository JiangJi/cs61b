New epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases

Learning objectives
1. Identify vaccine-preventable diseases that have occurred as epidemics in the recent past in the United States and abroad.
2. Provide possible biological reasons for why such epidemics may have occurred.
3. Provide possible sociological/behavioral or epidemiological reasons for why such epidemics may have occurred.
4. Describe new approaches and strategies to prevent such epidemics.

Vaccine-preventable diseases that have occurred as epidemics in the last few years
 Pertussis
 Mumps
 Hepatitis A
 Influenza
 Others

Mumps

Mumps vaccine
1945: Mumps virus first isolated
1948: Inactivated virus vaccine developed; provided short-lasting immunity—discontinued in 1970
1967!: Mumpsvax licensed in the US
Developed by Maurice Hilleman, MD—based on virus isolated from his daughter Jeryl Lynn (called Jeryl Lynn strain), still used today.

2006 midwest outbreak
2009 northeast outbreak
#1989 2nd dose recommended because of the outbreak
Why come back?  Waning immunity based on model, 1989 outbreak mainly in teenagers
2006 older, college age <- 2nd dose 
If due to virus change, we are expected to see everybody susceptible, not just young kids

Reasons for the epidemics of mumps?
Change in vaccine coverage?  
Waning immunity?
Bad batch of vaccine?
Change in viral strain? (escape mutants)


No change in vaccine coverage, always high
18-22 and 11-17: why waning immunity
Mumps outbreak in university > community > schools > households
18-22 yrs: highest incidence in 2016
New ACIP recommendation, mumps (pending MMWR):anyone previously vaccinated with two doses of a mumps-containing vaccine who are identified by public health as at increased risk for mumps because of an outbreak should receive a third dose of a mumps-containing vaccine to improve protection against mumps disease and related complications

Influenza virus
Influenza viruses: 4 types—A, B, C, and D
Type A:
Infects birds, humans, other mammals
18 HA, 11 NA subtypes in birds and pigs
** H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes responsible for most seasonal epidemics **
Avian-origin H2, H5, H6, H7, H9, H10 HA subtypes associated with sporadic infections in humans
Type B:
Infects only humans
Causes seasonal epidemics
Type C:
Infects humans and pigs
Type D:
Infects cattle
Vaccine includes type A and type B
15

Influenza vaccine effectiveness: Cochrane reviews (Demicheli V et al, 2018)
Health adults (16-65 yrs):
Found 52 RCT with over 80,000 people; 25 evaluated in this study 
Single influenza season in North America, South America, and Europe between 1969 and 2009
Vaccines reduced influenza from 2.3% (no vaccination) to 0.9% (vaccination; RR 0.41)
Number needed to vaccinate (NNV): 71 (needed to be vaccinated to prevent 1 influenza case)
No appreciable effect on hospitalization or number of working days lost
NNV: lower the number, higher the vaccine efficacy
22

Influenza vaccine effectiveness: Cochrane reviews (2018)
Children (3-16 yrs) (Jefferson, T et al, 2018)
 41 clinical trials, > 200,000 children
 Single season in USA, Western Europe, Russia, and Bangladesh between 1984 and 2013
 Reduced the risk of influenza from 18% (unvaccinated) to 4% (vaccinated; risk ratio 0.22)
 Number needed to vaccinate (NNV): 7
 ? Effect on parents taking time off work (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03)
Elderly (>65 yrs) (Demicheli V, et al, 2018)
 Eight RCTs, over 5000 participants
 Community and residential care settings in Europe and the USA between 1965 and 2000
 Reduced the risk of influenza from 6% (vaccinated) to 2.4% (unvaccinated, risk ratio 0.42)
 NNV: 30
 Could not assess effect on mortality due to low number of deaths in both groups.


Why this year?
Vaccine coverage low
Vaccine doesn’t cover the strain
28


Reasons for the current epidemic of influenza?
Change in vaccine coverage?  
Waning immunity?
Bad batch of vaccine?
Change in viral strain? 

New approaches to influenza vaccine development—universal vaccine
HA stem protein-based vaccine
 Sequential immunization: live attenuated virus, followed by inactivated virus immunization elicits anti-stem protein antibodies
 Mini-stem immunogens—protected mice from death but not from viral replication
Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRAs) for HA head region
 layering of consensus HA protein sequences to generate a consensus sequence
 recapitulate amino acid changes in the virus during the past years to present
 may require multiple antigens (“cocktail”)

Hepatitis A

Picornavirus

Hepatitis A vaccine
Killed, inactivated virus propagated in a cell line (depends on manufacturer)
Licensed in the US in 1996 (1991 in Europe)
>90% effective, long-lasting (15 yrs or longer)
# Circulating: get re-expose

Epidemiology of hepatitis A in the United States
Pre-Vaccine era: 
 cyclic increases every 10-15 yrs
 >21,000 cases/year 
95% decrease since 1999
  

Recent foodborne outbreaks of Hep A, United States, 2013-16

 10 states, 165 cases, 71 hospitalizations
 Traced back to pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey
2016: Multistate outbreak due to frozen strawberries (Tropical Smoothie Café)
 9 states, 143 cases, 56 hospitalizations
 Traced back to imported strawberries from Egypt
2016: Hawaii—raw scallops, imported from the Phillipines

High hospitalization to infection rate
Last 3 years: foodborne gone down but community outbreaks increased
Outbreak in homeless population
41

>1400 outbreak-associated cases between July 2016-Dec 2017
42

Multistate hepatitis A outbreak: United States, March, 2017-
States: California, Michigan, Utah, Kentucky
Transmission: Homeless persons, injection drug users
Strain: Genotype 1B

Death uniform , not very high <- old, underlying medical conditions
43

Hep A outbreak, California, 2017- 
Same genotype but cities are not close: maybe traveller? 
44

Reasons for the outbreaks of Hep A?
Larger pool of unvaccinated people?
Increased foreign travel?
Increased homelessness?   <-first time become risk factor
Waning vaccine efficacy?
New viral strain?

Prevalence of anti-HA antibody, NHANES, United States, 1999-2000 vs 2009-2010
More kids get vaccinated
47


Hep A in homeless populations
Increased homelessness?
Homelessness never previously considered a risk factor for Hep A
What’s the mode of transmission among homeless people?
What’s the link between Southern CA and Northern CA outbreaks?
#Person to person, contact fecal
Share food
Southern and northern ca: related, maybe IV used people travelled

Recommendation for Hep A vaccine
All children at age 1 year
Travelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A
Family members and caregivers of recent adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common
Men who have sexual contact with other men
People who use injection and non-injection illegal drugs
People with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C
People who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates
People who work with hepatitis A infected animals or in a hepatitis A research laboratory

New recommendations?
Identify risk factors for transmission among homeless people.
Vaccinate homeless people and other risk groups previously not included?
Rapid mobilization of vaccines.
Rapid sequencing of the virus implicated in outbreaks.

NEW VACCINES FOR EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

Learning objectives
Be able to discuss why we need or do not need a new vaccine for dengue, Ebola, Zika and other emerging epidemic-causing infectious diseases.
Understand the challenges to developing a new vaccine against dengue, Ebola and Zika viruses?
Biological challenges
Sociological challenges
Understand what we have learned so far from clinical trials.

1. Ebola virus disease (EVD)
filovirus

EVD epidemic in West Africa, 2013-16
Why explosion? Virus enter very densed city, highly transmissive
Nothing related to culture

Ebola virus
Single strand RNA virus, member of Filoviridae
Five species--Zaire Ebola virus, Sudan Ebola virus (Sudan virus), Reston Ebola virus (Reston virus), Taï Forest Ebola virus (Tai Forest virus), and Bundibugyo Ebola virus (Bundibugyo virus).

Ebola epidemic—West Africa, 2013-16 
>28000 cases, 11,308 deaths mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia
2/5 died
Caused by Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV)
Transmitted by direct contact with blood; sexual transmission documented


Ebola virus disease
Pathogenesis:
Viral glycoprotein (GP) facilitates uptake into macrophages
Exaggerated cytokine expression
Correlate of protection?? 
IgG response and intact CMI responses observed in survivors
Clinical manifestations:
Severe bleeding, coagulation irregularities, gastrointestinal bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, shock
# cytokine expression: shock, vascular leakage


Do we need a vaccine against EVD?
#BCG: give to certain areas
#Go aborad(typhoid vaccine)

Ebola vaccine candidates
Vaccine type                    Key components              Efficacy (animal)
Inactivated virus | Formalin, heat, irradiated virus | No effect (mice, guinea pig)
Subunit | EBOV gene in bacterial plasmid (DNA vaccine): GP, NP, VP35 or VP40 genes |Full protection (mice, guinea pig)
Virus-like particle |  VP40 +/-GP | Full protection (mice, guinea pig)
Vaccinia virus vector | Recombinant vaccinia virus: GP, VP24, VP35 and VP40|Incomplete protection (guinea pig), No protection (non-human primate)
Venezuelan equine virus (VEE) replicon |Recombinant VEE virus: NP, GP(single cycle replication)|Full protection (mice),No protection (NHP)
Adenovirus vector |Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5:NP, GP (replication deficient)| Complete protection (NHP)
Vesiculovirus (VSV) vector | Recombinant VSV: GP(replication competent) | Complete protection  (mice), 50% protection in guinea pig, NHP
Challenge virus: Zaire EBOV
#Adenovirus vector<- human have the virus antibody, failure
#Use different serotype
9

Ebola vaccine candidates—post-exposure
Incubation period after exposure: 2-3 weeks
Vaccine can be given after exposure to prevent disease?
 Protection in mice (100%) and guinea pigs (50%) given VSV-GP 24-hrs after infection with Zaire EBOV (Feldman H et al, PLoS Path, 2007)
 50% protection in NHP given VSV-GP 20-30 min after infection with ZEBOV (Feldman H et al); 100% in NHP in subsequent study (Geisbert TW et al, J Virol 2009).
# Problem: you don’t know infection time

Other approaches to EBOV vaccine development
li-key hybrid technology: Peptide made from MHC Class II-associated invariant chain li-protein linked to EBOV antigen (Erskine CL, J Immunol, 2011)
 Facilitates strong MHC Class II loading and CD4 T cell presentation
 Induces strong humoral immune response
 Found to be safe in human phase I and II trials
 Humoral response long-lasting (>3 yrs)
#Antigen Express
Forces MHC present specific antigen you want it to present

Vaccine efficacy: 100%
Adverse events: minimal (headache, fatigue, muscle aches)
ring vaccination: vaccine contacts of cases/ people surrounding the people with disease
(7 clusters means there are 7 primary cases


2. Zika virus (ZIKV) disease 

Zika virus
First identified in Rhesus monkey in Zika forest, Uganda in 1947
Member of the flavivirus (dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, JE)
First human cases: Nigeria, 1952-4 (three cases)
13 naturally-acquired cases over next 57 years

Piercing scream
# Microphaly can develop even after birth
25

CZS cohort study, Niteroi, Brazil (Renata V et al)
125 children of pregnant mothers with rash, or children 
suspected to have CZS whose mother had rash during pregnancy
4 excluded
Group 1: 39 children of mothers 
who tested positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR
Group 2: 31 children of mothers 
who tested negative for ZIKV by RT-PCR
Group 3: 51 children of mothers 
never tested by RT-PCR

CZS cohort study, Niteroi, Brazil (Renata V et al)

CZS cohort study, Niteroi, Brazil (Renata V et al)

Group 2 (RT-PCR-): Confirmed CZS: 0
Group 3 (No RT-PCR): Confirmed CZS: 13 (25.5%); 12 microcephaly
Biased sample due to post-hoc data
Retrospectively ask if the mother has rash <- biased 
28

Do we need a vaccine against ZIKV?
Give to mothers in endemic ares.
asymptomatic
29

Whom should a ZIKV vaccine target?
Women of childbearing age
Elderly population in endemic countries?
Newborns in endemic countries?
Men of childbearing age?
Travelers to endemic countries?
Newborns: protected by maternity immunity? Give vaccine?
30

What do we know about immune response to ZIKV?
Many potential receptors for ZIKV--dendritic-cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin, Axl receptor tyrosine kinase, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1, tyrosine protein kinase 3
Antibody to E protein protective; cross-reacts with dengue E protein (E protein 99% identical at AA level across all ZIKV strains)
Do we need to worry about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)?
Do we need to worry about “original antigenic sin”?
 Biased memory immune response to the primary infecting microbe during subsequent infection with a microbe with a slightly different antigenic property at the sacrifice of mounting an effective response to the second infection.

ZIKV from Thailand protects against subsequent challenge with ZIKV from Puerto Rico in rhesus macaque (Osuna CE et al, Nature Med,2016)
ZIKV from east Africa induces protective immunity against French Polynesia ZIKV strain

Unanswered questions:
In utero transmission in infected mother—what does this tell you?
Sexual transmission from male to female—what does this tell you?
 Herd immunity?  None of the vaccines to date have been evaluated to test for inducing herd immunity.
Will a ZIKV induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)?
# Only against animal challenge, mother will develop immunity against virus, but fetus still infected -> no protection against transmission!!!!!
Vaccine should protect against transmission, but no vaccine can do that now -> we don’t want vaccine against mother’s rash, but fetus 


3. Dengue 


Dengue virus
SS+RNA virus, member of Flavivirus.
Four major serotypes  
DENV1
DENV2
DENV3
DENV4
69% to 78% similar in AA sequence
55 to 56% similar in AA sequence to ZIKV

Dengue
WHO: 400 million new infections 100 million new symptomatic cases annually

Dengue clinical manifestations:
Asymptomatic infection
Dengue fever
 fever, arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain, rash
Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
Dengue shock syndrome (DSS)
 Over 2 million DHF/DSS cases and 20,000 deaths

Do we need a vaccine against DENV?
Very common disease, widely spread
More death
38

What do we know about immune response to DENV?
Type I interferon response important for protection.
Humoral immune response to one DENV serotype protective against the same serotype.
E protein main target of neutralizing antibodies.
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE): 
Occurs during secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype. 
Cross-reactive sub-neutralizing antibodies from the first infection form DENV-antibody 
    complexes and bind to FcγRs on macrophages. 
Facilitates viral entry and replication—leads to vascular plasma leakage and severe clinical manifestation
#ADE especially young children
sub-neutralizing: help virus to enter

Antibody-dependent enhancement 
DENV + sub neutralizing Ab -> combine with FcR, increased entry into FCR bearing cells -> increased virus production -> increased viremia and viral burden in other tissues -> increased disease severity
#Happens to other virus, but not as the magnitude of dengue


DENV vaccines under development and evaluation
Vaccine type | Key component
Inactivated virus | Inactivated whole virus, monovalent, tetravalent
Attenuated virus | Monvalent, bivalent, tetravalent DENV chimeric virus (2000)
Plasmid DNA | Tetravalent prM/E expressed from plasmid vector
Virus-vectored vaccines |YFV, Venezualan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus, adenovirus, Measles virus: Tetravalent, monovalent
Subunit vaccines | EDIII-p64k fusion proteins and EDIII-capsid fusion proteins expressed in E. coli;
                   Bivalent 80E-STF2 fusion proteins expressed in baculovirus/insect cells;
                   Tetravalent consensus EDIII protein expressed in E. coli
No good animal models available:
	Mice: intracerebral challenge, immunosuppressed mice, humanized mice
	NHP: Viremia but no disease

Phase III trial of dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV or Dengvaxia)
Meta-analysis of 3 trials of CYD-TDV (Hadinegoro SR et al, NEJM, 2015)
Vaccine: Chimeras of yellow fever 17D and PrM and E proteins from four DENV serotypes (Sanofi), given in 3 doses in 5 Asian and 5 Latin American countries.
35,000 children vaccinated
Pooled efficacy in first 25 mos: 65.6% (95% CI, 60.7 to 69.9) in >9 years of age or older; 44.6% (95% CI, 31.6 to 55.0) in <9 years of age.
Significantly higher number of vaccinated vs placebo children 2-5 years of age hospitalized with dengue.
Not observed in vaccinated children >5 years of age
SAGE predicts reduction of 10-30% in dengue-hospitalizations over 30 years in vaccinated children > 9 years age.
December, 2015: Recommendation: >9-year-olds in Mexico, Honduras, Brazil and the Philippines, and subsequently in 19 countries dengue-endemic regions.

Dengvaxia
Philippine government vaccinated >830,000 mostly 9-year-olds starting in April 2016.
18-months later, dengue hospitalization and deaths reported among vaccinated children.
Measure of efficacy of the vaccine may have been biased by scoring dengue hospitalizations of vaccinated children as vaccine failures rather than as vaccine
    enhanced dengue disease during the original trial (SB Halstead, Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, 2018). 
How do you assess vaccine failure vs vaccine-induced adverse event?
